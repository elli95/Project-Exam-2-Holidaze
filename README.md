<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is my second Project Exam at Noroff.
In this assignment, I created a booking site called Holidaze.
The project is a venue booking platform designed to facilitate hotel reservations, inquiries, and exploration of various venues. Users can browse through a curated selection of venues, gaining insights into their features, amenities, and availability. Additionally, users can book a venues or add their own venues to the platform.
